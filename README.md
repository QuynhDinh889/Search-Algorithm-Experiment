# Search-Algorithm-Experiment
This Java program implements and compares three search algorithms: Sequential Search, Binary Search, and Random Search.  Each algorithm tracks the minimum, maximum, and average number of iterations required to find a target value. 

## Features
- Fully implemented without built-in search libraries
- Object-oriented design using a parent abstract class and an Experimentable interface
- Automated experiments with 1,000 random searches for each algorithm
- Results sorted by average number of iterations

## Tech Stack
- Java, OOP (Inheritance, Interfaces, Polymorphism), Algorithms (Searching), Arrays
